JS
WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT:JS IS HIGH-LEVEL,OBJECT ORIENTED,MULTI-PARADIGM,PROGRAMING-LANGUAGE
PROGRAMING-LANGUGAE IS A TOOL WHICH ALLOW TO WRITE A CODE THAT WILL INSTRUCT THE COMPUTER TO DO SOMTHING
HIGH-LEVEL LANGUGUAGE MEANS DONT WANT TO WORRY ABT THE COMPLEX STUFF LIKE MEMORY MANAGEMENT 
OBJECT ORIENTED-BASED ON OBJECT FOR STORING MOST KIND OF DATA
MULTI PARADIGM-WE CAN USE DIFFERENT STYLE OF PROGRAMMING SUCH AS IMPARETIVE AND DECLEARATIVE
WHAT IS THE ROLE PLAED IN THAT -HTML,CSS,JS
WRITING THE CODE </SCRIPT> AFTER THE </STYLE> 
 <script>
    let js = 'amazing';
    if (js === 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is FUN !');
 WE LL GET ALERT IN OUTPUT OF DESKTOP IN NEW CROME OPENING
  JS IS FUN 
  FOR ADDING 
   40 + 8 + 23 - 10;
    console.log(40 + 8 + 23 - 10);
  </script>
  AFTER REFRESING AGAIN WE GET 
  ANSWER
  61           index.html:32 
  
  AGAIN SEPARTING A OUT OF HTML FILEAND PUT IT IN TO  ITS OWN SEPERATE JS FILE,SO WE HAVE THIS SCRIPT
  SCRIPT IS CALLED -INLINE SCRIPT-
  ADVANTAGE OF INLINE SCRIPT IS THAT WE DONT HAVE TO LOAD ANOTHER FILE
  WE HAVE TO CREATE A NEW FILE IN VS CODE AS SCRIPT.JS
  AND COPY THE CODE FROM LET JS TO CONSOLE.LOG AND PASTE IT IN A NEW FILE
  ND COME BACK TO OLD FILE ND SET UP BY REMOVING SCRIPT TWO LINES
  AND ALL WE HAVE TO DO NOW IS TO LINK THE JS FILE TO THE HTML FILE
  BECAUSE RIGHT THAT HTML DONT NO THE WHERE IT IS LOCATED
  SO IF WE EXECUTE THE CODE BY RELOADING THE BROWSER
  NOW NTG WILL HAPPEN
  AGAIN WE HAVE TO WRITE THE CODE ABOVE THE BODY OF LINE--<SCRIPT SRC="SCRIPT.JS"></SCRIPT>
  AND SAVE IT ND AGAIN RELOAD THE PAGE OF OUTPUT WE GET--
  JS IS FUN AS A ALERT 
  AND 61      cript.js:5 
  AND WE LEARNED NOW HOW TO LINK A JS FILE TO HTML FILE ND RUN THE BROWSER
  AND NOW MOVING ON TO THE STARTING WITH VALUES AND VERIABLES
  NOW REMOVING IN VS CODE THE 40+8+23-10 ,LINE AND ALSO IF-LINE
  IN THIS WE ARE USING A PERSON NAME AS EXAMPLE PERSON AGE,NUMBER,OR A JOB
  VALUE---IS A PIECE OF DATA so its a FUNDAMENTAL UNITOF INFORMATIONTHAT WE HAVE IN PROGRAMING 
  FOR EXAMPLE SUPREETHA IS VALUE    ,TO SEE A CONSOLE AGAIN WE HAVE TO GIVE CONSOLE.LOG("SUPREETHA");
  AFTER THIS RELOADING OUTPUT WR GET script.js:4 SUPREETHA
  WE CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT VALUES EXAMPLE LIKE 23  FOR NUMBER NO COLUMES ARE PRSENT
  SO NOW GOUNG TO CREAT A REAL VARIABLE LIKE--LET FIRSTNAME="SUPREETHA"--THAT WILL STORE THE VALUE IN VARIABLE LIKE NAME IS A VALUE
LIKE EXAMPLE LET JS='AMAZING' WHER JS IS A CALLED A VARIABLE AND 'AMAZING' IS ASSIGNED  A VALUE TO THAT VARIABLE
BOX=BOX CAN HOLD A OBJECT FOE EXAMPLE A BOOK AND WE CAN THEN WRITE A LABLE ON THE BOX TO DESCRIBE WTS IN IT TN WE CAN FIND THE OBJECT WTS IN IT BY SEEING A LABLE 
in code = we have to write let firstName="=SUPREETHA";
                           console.log(firstName);
     save nd load output we get SUPREETHA script.js:8 SUPREETHA
     THAT MEAN THAT INDEED OR VARIABLE DECLARATION UP HERE WORKED
     VARIABLE'S CAN BE REPETED CONSOLE.LOG HOW MANY TIMES WE WANT
     CONVENTIONS AND RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES--BECAUSE WE SHOULD NOT GIVE RANDOM NAME TO VARIABLES
     camelCase notation MEANS---- WHENEVER I HAVE  MULTIPLE WORDS IN A VARIABLE NAME,I WRITE THE FIRST WITH A LOWERCASE
     LOWERCASE MEANS--WRITE A FIRST WORD WITH SMALL WORDS AND REST WITH STARTING WITH CAPTIAL WORDS======firstNamePerson like that example
     variable name can't start with the number 123456789 LIKE THAT EXAMPLE
     VARIABLE CAN NOT CONTAIN NUMBERS, AND IT CONTAIN LETTERS,UNDERSCORES,OR THE DOLLAR ASSIGN   
     EXAMPLE suppi&sind its a error
     if we write suppi_sind its corrt
     we should not start with an uppercase letter so we should not again its a error
     if it a REAL CONSTANS WRITE IT IN A UPPERCASE LIKE EXAMPLE PI=3.1456
     MAKE SURE A VARIABLE NAME SHOULD BE DESCRIPTIVE
     SHOULD WRITE A CODE VARIABLE IN MANNER 
let myFirstJob = 'Programmer';
let myCurrentJob = 'Teacher';

let job1 = 'programmer';
let job2 = 'teacher';
ASSIGNMENT 1 =VALUE AND VARIABLE 
LECTURE: Values and Variables
1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
2. Log their values to the console
MY WORK====
let myCountry = 'INDIA';
let myContinent = 'ASIA';
let myCountryPopulation = '1,404,235,905';

console.log(myContinent);
console.log(myCountryPopulation);

ANSWER====;;;;
script.js:24 ASIA
script.js:25 1,404,235,905
LET NOW LEARN DATATYPES IN JS 
EVERY VALUE IS A EITHER AN OBJECT OR A PRIMITIVE VALE
PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES ARE==7
1.NUMBER =FLOTING POINT NUMBER USED IN DECIMALS AND INTEGER-let age=22;
2.STRING=SEQUENCE OF NUMBER USED TO TEXT-let firstName='SUPREETHA'; always put them in quots no matter single or double
3.BULLION=logical TYPE THAT CAN BE TRUE OR FALSE USED FOR DESCION TAKING -let fullAge=true;
4.UNDEFINED=value taken BY A VARIABLE THAT IS NOT YET DEFINED  USED TO EMPTY VALUE-let children; 
5.NULL=ALSO MEAN EMPTY VALUE-let things;
6.SYMBOL=NOT VERY USEFIL FOR US ,=VALUE THAT IS UNIQUE AND CANNOT BE CHANGED
7.AND BIG INT=LARGE INTEGER THAN THE NUMBER TYPE CAN HOLD
JS HAVE A FEATURE CALEED DYNAMIC TYPING 
  VALUE THAT A TYPES IN JS NOT VARIABLES 
  CODE COMMENTING=TO DEACTIVATE A CODE WITHOUT DELETING IT FOR SINGLE LINE COMMENT-//     //
  FOR MULTIE LINE -COMMENT WE SHOULD USE -/*        */
  
WE CAN ALSO STORE A BOOLEANS IN AVARIABLES
SO LETS SAY let javascriptIsFun using (camelcase notation)= true;
now console.log(javascriptIsFun);
TYPE OF= IS AN OPERATOR=JUST LIKE PLUS OR MINUS OPERATIONS TO SHOW THE VALUE
DYNAMIC TYPING IS SIMPLY MEANS THAT WE CHANGETHE TYPE OF A VALUE THAT IS HOLD BY A VARIABLE
FIRST WE HAVE TO WRITE A LET ANYTHING AFTER THAT ,WE HAVE TO CHANGE WE SIMPLE WRITE IT AGAIN LIKE BUT WITHOUT LET
USING A BOX AANALOG BEFORE NOW PUTTING A BOOK IN A BOX AND LATER A BOOK OUT OF THE BOX INSTEAD PUTITNG A PHONE INTO A BOX JUST LIKE CHNAGEING THE CONTENT OF BOX
NUMBER,STRING,BOOLEAN ARE THE MOST USED DATATYPES IN JS
NOW LET LOOK TO EMPTY UNDEFINED 
EXAMP - LET YEAR;
         CONSOLE.LOG(YEAR);
         CONSOLE.LOG(TYPEOF YEAR);
IT GIVES AN UNDEFINED
TYPE OF NULL IS A OBJECT
now lets now take a look THREE DIFFEENT WAYS OF DECLARING VARIABLES IN JS
LET,CONST AND VAR
THE VALUE IN A CONST VARIABLE CANNOT BE CHANGED

NOW LETS GO TO STRINGS AND TEMPLATE LITERALS=HOW TO BUILT A STRING WITH USING SOMETHING TEMPLATES LITERALS;
NOW LET CREATE A LINE IN CODE BY TAKING VARIABLE
WE CAN USE A + SIGN TO CONCATINATE A STRING

now lets go to next string means writing a $ we get output
\n means=NEW LINE

IF\ELSE STATEMENT=
